# endless-runner-game
An endless runner game created using unity for android and web. I created this game for my mobile app development subject and to test my ability in c# and learn more about game development.

I created three versions of this game:
  1. Firebase version (covid-runner-firebase folder), where an online leaderboard and an account is needed to play. Please take note that I removed firebase sdk from the firebase version since it is too large to be uploaded, add firebase sdk before working with the project or it will give you an error.
  2. Non-firebase version (covid-runner-nofirebase folder), where theres no online leaderboard and no account is needed to play.
  3. WEBGL version (Build, TemplateData, index.html) that can be accessed through this link: https://rdiazjr.github.io/endless-runner-game-unity/.
